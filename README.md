# Treehouse-project
These files are from my workspace from the Team Treehouse website. I'm currently working on how to build a website, but starting with a mobile version and adding more from there. My lastest code I wrote is on responsive.css. I added an ID for my profile phto under media query. It was suppose to adjust from a two column layout to a one column layout when the browser is adjusted (for mobile viewing). It seems the one column layout is not being applied and I am not sure where I went wrong. The profile photo is floating to the left and the text has wrapped to the bottom of the photo. This can be found on the about.html page when viewing from the link I added. Help! :(
